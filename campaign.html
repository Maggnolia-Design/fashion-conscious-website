                    <p>Many of today’s fashion industries participate in a culture of cheap, disposable, and “fast” fashion. While this offers consumers attractice benefits—namely, trendy clothing at an affordable price—the true cost of this “fast fashion” industry is steep. According to the Huffington Post, it is the world’s second "dirtiest" in the world.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, Fashion Conscious aims to shed light on the hidden costs of the fashion industry, with a focus on low worker wages and hazarous factory conditions. <strong>Let's change the way we buy and use our clothing, and create a cleaner fashion industry.</strong></p>

                  <h6>DEFINITION of 'Fast Fashion'</h6>
                  <p>The term “fast fashion” refers to a phenomenon in the fashion industry whereby production processes are expedited in order to get new trends to the market as quickly and cheaply as possible. As a result of this trend, the tradition of introducing new fashion lines on a seasonal basis is being challenged. Today, it is not uncommon for fast-fashion retailers to introduce new products multiple times in a single week.</p>
                  <div role="separator" class="divider"></div>
                  <h6>BREAKING DOWN the issues</h6>
                  <p>Fast fashion is made possible by innovations in supply chain management among fashion retailers. From the perspective of retailers, fast fashion is advantageous because the constant introduction of new products encourages customers to make frequent visits to stores. Yet despite its advantages for customers, fast fashion has also been criticized on the grounds that it encourages a “throw-away” attitude among consumers. The trend has also been criticized on intellectual property grounds, with some designers alleging that their designs have been illegally mass produced by retailers.</p>
                  <p>Ethical and environmental concerns are also high. According to the Institute of Sustainable Communication, the clothing industry is the second-highest polluter of clean water. And that’s not all. A report published in MIT News stated that most fast-fashion retailers outsource their production to developing countries where resources and labor come cheap, and where they still depend on coal power for electricity. The disparity between product distribution and place of production also requires a lot of oil (a non-renewable energy source) to ship clothing worldwide.</p>
